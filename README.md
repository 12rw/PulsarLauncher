# PulsarLauncher

@Beta Testers I need help with the new Launcher (Auto-Update feature): https://github.com/12rw/PulsarLauncher/releases/tag/v0.1.2
1. Uninstall your launcher from Programs in Windows
2. Download
3. Check that shows you TWELVE RANDOM WORDS - FZCO as company (probably blue screen but in MORE INFO should appear our company -> SIGNATURE and Microsoft certification works)
4. You should see 0.1.2 version, and the button download RED
5. Please share screenshot to confirm
